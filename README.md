# WorkFlowPlus
Workflow+ is a framework developed at McMaster University for the purpose of generating and maintain safety assurance cases. This repo contains the iteration of this framework developed in the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and implemented using Sirius. 

In order to get started you must have EMF and Sirius plugins installed. After you have them installed, open all of the metamodel files and the instance specification file in the project explorer of eclipse. Then open the wFP_V2.ecore graphical representation. Then right click anywhere in the blank space and navigate to generate and click on all. This will generate all of the files necessary to run the Sirius instance. 

Now create a new eclipse runtime application using the default settings. Once the new eclipse window is open, create a new modeling project. Then to create a new file right-click on the project and navigate to the 'other' tab. After you click on it you will be presented with a new window with many options for a file. Search for the wFP_V2 model and select it. This will create a new modeling file for you to use. In order to start the graphical representation of the model, navigate to the .aird file and enable wFP_V2 as a graphical representation. This will allow you to open the Sirius editor for creating WF+ models and get started on specifying your safety engineering practices.
